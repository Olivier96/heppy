class BlockBuilder(GraphBuilder):
    ''' BlockBuilder takes a set of identifiers and a dict of associated edges which have distance and link info
        It uses the distances between elements to construct a set of blocks
        Each element will end up in one (and only one block)
        Blocks retain information of the elements and the distances between elements
        The blocks can then be used for future particle reconstruction
        The ids must be unique and are expected to come from the Identifier class
        
        attributes:
        
        ids   : list of unique identifiers eg of tracks, clusters etc
        edges : dict of edges which contains all edges between the ids (and maybe more)
                an edge records the distance between two ids
        subtype :used when creating unique identifiers, normally 'r' reconstructed or 's' split
        history : dictionary of nodes that describe which elements are parents of which blocks 
                  it is provided so that the actions of the block builder can be recorded
        nodes : a set of nodes corresponding to the unique ids which is used to construct a graph
                and thus find distinct blocks
        blocks: the resulting blocks
    
        Usage example:
            builder = BlockBuilder(ids, edges, 'r', history)
            for b in builder.blocks.itervalues() :
                print b
